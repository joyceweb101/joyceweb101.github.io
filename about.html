                <blockquote>Hi! My name is Joyce Tai, studying in Canada for computer programming. I am the author of this webpage. I hope you enjoy it.
                     With a pile of cards, we can have fun with them. Slapjack is just one way of playing with cards. I hope that in the coming future, we can share more card games through this website.
                     Don't forget to <a href="index.html#subscribe-section">subscribe</a>my page!
