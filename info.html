                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players : 2 or more players, no strict limitation, with a least 3 players would be more enjoyable.</li>
                    <li>Deck: with standard 52-card deck</li>
                    <li>Dealer: 1 player acts as the dealer, shuffle the deck and deal all the cars face-down to the players.</li>
                    <li>How to win: win all the cards in the deck by being the quickest to "slap" the pile when certain cards are played</li>
                    <li>The Game: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start: start with the player in the left of the dealer, and takes turn clock-wisely </li>
                            <li>In Between: each player takes turn and plays the top card from their hand, face- up into the center of the playing area to create a pile</li>
                           <li>Slapping: </li>
                            <ol>    
                                <li>Jack: if a Jack is played, all players must immediately attempt to slap the pile with their hand. The first player to slap the pile successfully collects all the cards in the pile and adds them to their hand. </li>
                                <li>Double:  If two cards of the same rank are played consecutively, players must also attempt to slap the pile. The first player to slap the pile takes all the cards in the pile.</li>
                                <li>Sandwich:  If two cards of the same rank are separated by one different card, players must slap the pile. The first player to slap the pile takes all the cards.</li>                           
                            </ol>
                            <li>Winning: The game continues until one player collects all the cards and wins the game.</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h2>Strategies in playing</h2>
                <p>Slapjack is a game that relies more on quick reflexes and observational skills rather than strategic planning. However, there are a few tips that players can keep in mind to improve their chances of winning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay Alert: Pay close attention to the cards being played by other players. Being alert and focused will help you recognize slappable cards quickly.</li>
                    <li>Observe Patterns: Look for patterns in the cards being played. For example, if you see two cards of the same rank played in succession, be ready to slap the pile for a "Double" win.</li>
                    <li>Control Your Slaps: Only slap the pile when you are confident that a valid slappable card is present. Avoid false slaps, as they may lead to penalties.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy the Game: Slapjack is meant to be a fun and lively game. Embrace the excitement, laughter, and friendly competition it brings.</li>
                </ul>
